## Expected Outcomes
The client wants the report to do more than just provide the answers to specific questions that were asked, but to be able to give insights that would enable the implementation of strategies.

## Recommendations

The Mac Book reached its peak sales to $8,037,000 more buyers drawn in October and December. Based on these periods' the client is advised to increase his stock of this product during those months.

Of the total Mac Book sales, California appears as the state with the highest Mac Book sales accounting for 40% of the entire Mac Books' sale. This can make one consider making more investments against targeting this location.

Fundamentally, January records low sales at $1.8 million. This means that the client should thus be keen on making purchases of the products during this time, as December emerges with the highest sales at $4.62 million. Considering this aspect, the client should consider adopting marketing strategies.

From the analysis, Mac Book, iPhone, ThinkPad Laptop, Google Phone and 27in 4K Gaming Monitor hold the best 5 products whereas AAA Batteries, AA Batteries, Wired Headphones, USB-C Charging Cable and Lighting Charging Cable. The sales curve from January to June totals $15.94 million, and at the end of the year, it raises up to an impressive $18.55.

It is then followed by AAA Batteries which are recording the least sales among the product category, even though they are the most sold. Discount offers should be upon these products.

In general, to optimize sales, it is recommended to buy more products, increase stock, and focus on selling during peak hours.
